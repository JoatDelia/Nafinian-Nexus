==========Nafinian Nexus Modding Menu Notes==========

When first one enters the Modding Menu, they are asked if they wish to make a new mod, open an existing one, or duplicate and open an existing one.

[[[Basic Details]]]
Label               Type            Function
"Name:"             Text Field      Name of the mod
"Credits..."        Button          Leads to Credits submenu
"This is an:"       Radio Buttons   If "Adventure", this is a stand-alone mod. If "Add-On", this is meant to modify existing adventures.
"Modifiable by:"    Radio Buttons   Can be "Anything", "Add-ons meant for this adventure", "Nothing". Only appears if this is an adventure.
"Can modify:"       Text Field      Help text will note that leaving this empty means it can modify any adventure that allows itself to be modified by any add-ons. This only appears if this is an add-on.
"Requires..."       Button          Leads to the Requires submenu
"Title Image:"      File Select     As the name implies.

There will be a static text message as well, reading: "Remember to back up your work often!"


__Credits Submenu__
At the top will be two labels: "Position" and "Names".

Under "Position" will be a single text field. Under "Names" will be a text field which will expand if Enter is pressed, to allow putting in more than one name (escape must be pressed to finish inputting, a fact which the help box should notify the user of). 

Under that will be an "Add" button, which will add another row of text fields. The help text will notify the user that any rows with a field left blank will be removed from the credits upon exiting the menu.


__Requires Submenu__
This will include a single massive multiline text field. A label at the top will instruct the user to type the name of a required add-on on each line. It will also say that if this add-on requires a specific ADVENTURE, then that belongs in the "Can Modify" field, not here.

[[[World Map]]]
This menu first opens up into a map selection screen, with an "Add New Map", which will give the option to either create a static map or a dynamic map. Static maps are made in advance, while dynamic maps are generated differently each playthrough. For dynamic maps, see the steps system example at the bottom of the document.

"Resize"            Button      Opens a separate window to input the new dimensions, each of which can be up to four digits long. If the size is reduced, the user must further specify in what way it should be reduced (in other words, which sides tiles should be removed from).
"Edit Map"          Button      In bottom left. Goes to the map editing screen.
"Edit Events"       Button      In bottom right. Goes to event editing screen.
